Rust Redis Server
===================


This is my implementation of a minimally-featured redis server in rust guided by the Tokio tutorial found [here](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial). 

Tokio is a runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with the Rust programming language. I am implementing this project and studying Tokio so that I may begin contributing to the Ethereum 2.0 Lighthouse Client and also because asynchronous execution is dope and I want to develop a sharper intuition for writing asynchornous code with Rust.
